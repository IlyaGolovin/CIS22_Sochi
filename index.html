        <p><strong>Sochi</strong> 
    There's nothing better than a Sochi vacation. 
    Whether you're sipping on refreshing cocktails at a local bar or reading 
    your favorite novel by the water's edge, your trip to Sochi is the time to 
    live out your beachy fantasies. Many visitors stay near Adler Beach, situated 
    just 12 miles (20 km) from the center of town. However, you'll also discover an 
    excellent range of Sochi vacation packages close to Dagomys Beach and Khosta Beach, 
    two other superb nearby options..</p>

      <h3>Hello Sochi</h3>
      <p>Sochi, a Russian city on the Black Sea, is known as a summer beach resort, 
         and was host of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Its parks include the palm-filled Arboretum. 
         It's also notable for 20th-century neoclassical buildings such as the columned Winter Theatre.
         Forested Sochi National Park is a 1,937-sq.-km protected area in the nearby Caucasus Mountains. 
         Some 70 km inland, Krasnaya Polyana is a prominent ski resort</p>

    <div class="col-1-2">
  <h3>Enjoy beaches</h3>
  <p>When Russians come to Sochi, they want to swim in the Black Sea! It's one of the main attractions,
     the warm sea! It has echoes of the Soviet era when Russians could only vacation within the Soviet Union, 
     the beaches are still packed!

      <h3>Caucasus Mountains</h3>
      <p>Nestled between the Caucasus Mountains and the Black Sea,
          the city of Sochi is one of Russia's premium tourist resort towns.
           As a popular destination, it offers a great selection of places to stay, 
           including everything from globally renowned chains and charming boutique hotels, 
           to family-owned pensions and self-catering apartments. 
           Many of these are located close to the coast and include rooms with a sea view.
            For budget travelers, the city also has several hostels to choose from. 
            Sochi is predominantly a summer destination, and the accommodation prices 
            vary depending on the season.</p>

  <h3>Night Life</h3>
  <p>If you want to get into Cocos, you must look the part. 
     The ‘face control’ (when bouncers selectively admit guests into the club so it looks like the venue is really exclusive and fancy) 
     is fierce. So, dress up. As a result of this door policy, Cocos is one of the most sought-after places to spend a night. 
     DJs spin every night of the week, and the club has an extensive range of cocktails, from more familiar drinks, 
     to house-made concoctions, to tropical tiki-inspired libations. It also is a restaurant and bar.</p>

                  <h2>FAQ</h2>
                  <dl>
                     <dt>Do you do weddings?</dt>
                     <dd>Yes! That's our favorite thing to do. We sell bulk chocolates 
                        in a wide variety of box designs perfect for weddings or 
                        other special occasions.</dd>
                     <dt>How long do your chocolates last?</dt>
                     <dd>We recommend that you store our chocolates in a dark, cool 
                        place and consume them within two weeks of purchase.</dd>
                     <dt>What varieties are you selling?</dt>
                     <dd>We're constantly updating our product list to match seasonal 
                        expectations. Typically we have between 12 and 18 varieties at 
                        any one time.</dd>
                     <dt>Can I customize my own box?</dt>
                     <dd>Of course! We have special gift boxes but if you want to 
                        create a box of your favorites, we're glad to oblige.</dd>
                     <dt>Can I request a special variety?</dt>
                     <dd>We're happy to consider requests, but remember that some 
                        varieties are seasonal and cannot always be made to order.</dd>
                     <dt>What about peanut allergies?</dt>
                     <dd>We can produce box sets without nuts, but our factory  is 
                        not a nut-free environment, so some fragments might get 
                        into your box however much we try to avoid it.</dd>
                     <dt>How much is shipping?</dt>
                     <dd>Rates vary based on the size of the order and the destination. 
                        Typically we charge between $10 and $15 for 2nd-day delivery.</dd>
                     <dt>Do you ship outside of the United States?</dt>
                     <dd>We can ship to Canada and parts of Mexico; however given the 
                        effect of extended travel on our product's quality, we do not
                        generally ship to countries or states that are farther away 
                        than that.</dd>
                     <dt>Where is Pandaisia?</dt>
                     <dd>Glad you asked. Pandaisia is not a place; it's the name of 
                        the Greek goddess of the banquet and what's a banquet without 
                        chocolate?</dd>
